This is a project course where I participated.
Class: Cloud Computing 
Semester: Fall 2015
Professor: Dr. Xiaolin Andy Li.

Description: Distributed filesystem to backup files in multiple clouds. Supports failure recovery and deduplication. We modified NCCloud to include support to Onedrive, Google Drive, and Dropbox. We also began the development of a Web Interface using Django.
